Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- You learned about GitHub, repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
- You created a branch, a commit, and a pull request.
- You merged a pull request.
- You made your first contribution! :tada:

### What's next?

  If you'd like to make a profile README, use the simplified instructions below or follow the instructions in the [Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) article.
  1. Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
  2. Create a file named `README.md` in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
  3. Edit the contents of the `README.md` file.
  4. If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
  5. We'd love to see your new profile! Share your profile on social media and tag us!
  6. Lastly, we'd love to hear what you thought of this course [in our discussion board](https://github.com/skills/.github/discussions).
